scmnote:

	scmnote is short for Scheme Note, which is a concept I have about making 
a pretty recursive lisp/scheme based music format.  The format should be easy to put simple things together by hand, and easy to parse in order to make a nice graphical interface.

The basic idea is that a melody is either simply a note:

	$ cat note.sn
	c4

or it is a list of notes:

	$ cat simple.sn 
	(c4 c# d d# e e# e## g ab a bb b c5)

or it is a group of such constructions, combined in some way, such
as being played simultaneously:

	$ cat merger.sn
	(sim 
		(c4 c# d d# e e# e## g ab a bb b c5)
		(e4 e# f# g g# a a# b c5 c# d d# e))
