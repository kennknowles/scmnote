Figure out how to give some extensibility - it makes sense to me that
since guile is being used, guile function calls should be allowed to
permute the input... I don't know if the whole program should be moved into
scheme, since the data structures are complex and guile's OO is unstable
(in the rapidly-changing way - i could be wrong).
But nevertheless, scheme functions to create new scmnote from other
scmnote should be allowed.

Make the debugging output multi-tiered so that additional -v -vv -vvv can
expose more of it, because right now its crazy...

perhaps -v NUM where 0 <= NUM < 128, and we can give ranges to types of output
