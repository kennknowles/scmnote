.SH NAME
scmnote \- a scheme-like music system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR scmnote\ [OPTIONS]\ [FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
scmnote is a scheme-like music notation system.  It takes a text file, which
is a representation of a song, loosely tied to a midi-like event structure,
and outputs a corresponding midi file.
.PP
scmnote has a philosophy of reusable structures, and is much more high-level
than midi.  It reverts to midi concepts only for instrument changes, and
specifying different channels of midi (otherwise all instrument changes
would affect the same channel).

.SH OPTIONS
scmnote supports the following options:
.sp
.nf
   -h         --help             Print help and exit
   -V         --version          Print version and exit
   -oSTRING   --out-file=STRING  output file, INFILE.ns -> INFILE.mid
   -s         --stdout           output to stdout (default=off)
.fi

.SH FILES
The input file to scmnote must contain exactly one well-formed scheme
expression.  It is assume that the entirety of the structure is 'quoted',
so no quotation is necessary.
.PP

Here is a context free grammar
(abbreviated with regular expressions) for scmnote, note that this grammar
only contains those features which are implemented - expect the keyword
section to grow:
.PP

SCMNOTE :=  CONSTRUCTION
.PP

CONSTRUCTION := NOTE
            |   LIST
.PP

NOTE := [a-g][0-9] ( #* | b* ) o*
.PP

LIST := null
    |   ( LIST_TAIL )
    |   ( KEYWORD LIST_TAIL )
.PP

LIST_TAIL :=    CONSTRUCTION
        |       CONSTRUCTION LIST_TAIL
.PP

KEYWORD :=  sim

.PP

The midi file that is output is a Format 1 midi file, and does not currently
take advantage of the "Running Status" that midi uses to optimize for size.

The description file consists of lines with the following format:

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Eventually, scmnote should take a look at an environment variable for
default options (if it ever has useful options)

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If scmnote gives you trouble, please email the developers, as it
is a really dumb program with few (if any) useful error messages

.SH BUGS
As far as I know, scmnote is bug-free.  This of course means that it has
hundreds and hundreds (despite the improbability considering how small it
is).
