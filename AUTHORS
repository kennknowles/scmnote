Kenneth Knowles <kknowles@uclink.berkeley.edu>
	Kenn is a senior at UC berkeley in Electrical Engineering and Computer
	Science.  They mush it all up, but he is interested is CS theory
	primarily, and also likes language design.  He conceived of
	scmnote while searching desperately in the summer of 2001 for a good
	note editing program under linux (when he coverted) and found none.
	He didn't get around to doing a damn thing until fall 2002.
